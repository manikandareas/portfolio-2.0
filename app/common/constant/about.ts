	Hi!, I'am Vito Andareas Manik, a junior frontend developer navigating the exciting realm of programming. My journey into the world of coding began in 2020, and it wasn't until 2022 that I decided to dive deep into honing my skills. My proficiency lies in languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, and a touch of Golang.
</p>
<p>
	One of my strengths is a robust problem-solving ability, a skill I've cultivated along with my capacity to thrive under pressure. I find myself particularly drawn to the fascinating universe of web development, with a special focus on mastering the Next.js framework. This framework, with its dynamic features, has become a cornerstone of my skills.
</p>
<p>
	My commitment to learning and staying abreast of the latest trends in web development is unwavering. As a junior frontend developer, I bring to the table not just technical expertise but also a passion for innovation. I am excited about the possibilities that coding presents and look forward to contributing my skills to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
